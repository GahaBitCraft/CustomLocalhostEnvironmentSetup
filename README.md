## üõ† Installation & Setup

### Requirements

- XAMPP installed and running.
- PHP enabled (default in XAMPP).
- Projects placed inside the `htdocs/` directory.

### Steps

1. **Download or clone the repository** into your XAMPP `htdocs/` folder (or any subfolder):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/xampp/htdocs/
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CustomLocalhostEnvironmentSetup.git
  
2. Backup your existing index.php in htdocs/ (if any).

3. Copy index.php from this repo to your htdocs/ root folder:

    ```bash
    cp CustomLocalhostEnvironmentSetup/index.php
    ```

4. (Optional) Add config.json files in your project folders to customize their display.

    Example config.json:

          {
            "name": "Awesome App",
            "description": "A cool app running locally.",
            "icon": "fa-rocket",
            "thumbnail": "thumb.png"
          }
    
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/ to see the dashboard.
